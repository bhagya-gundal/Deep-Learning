# Deep-Learning
This repository is used to demonstrate deep learning algorithm (Convolutional Neural Network) using TensorFlow. 
## Abstract
The goal of this project is to create a Deep Learning model. The dataset has 5 types of ships which are {'Cargo': 1, 'Military': 2, 'Carrier': 3, 'Cruise': 4, 'Tankers': 5}. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained with the images of various types of ships using a 60% of the data and validate simulataneously against 20% of the data and finally test the training with the remaining 20% of the data. The CNN is adjusted with various hyperparameters like using different activation functions, loss functions, changing the epochs, using various initialisers, changing network size and layers and finally obtaining the best accurate version of the CNN for the data. The programming is done in TensorFlow language by Google and loss and accuracy plot indicate how good or bad the network is trained aganist the data.
